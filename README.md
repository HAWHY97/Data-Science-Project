INTRODUCTION 
Financial inclusion remains one of the main obstacles to economic and human development in Africa. For example, across Kenya, Rwanda, Tanzania, and Uganda only 9.1 million adults (or 14% of adults) have access to or use a commercial bank account. 
 
Traditionally, access to bank accounts has been regarded as an indicator of financial inclusion. Despite the proliferation of mobile money in Africa, and the growth of innovative fintech solutions, banks still play a pivotal role in facilitating access to financial services. Access to bank accounts enable households to save and make payments while also helping businesses build up their creditworthiness and improve their access to loans, insurance, and related services. Therefore, access to bank accounts is an essential contributor to long-term economic growth. 
 
The objective of this competition is to create a machine learning model to predict which individuals are most likely to have or use a bank account. The models and solutions developed can provide an indication of the state of financial inclusion in Kenya, Rwanda, Tanzania and Uganda, while providing insights into some of the key factors driving individuals’ financial security. 
 
PROBLEMS AND CHALLENGES 
The business problem here is to predict which Individuals are most likely to have a Bank Account i.e., create a model that can predict customers with an active bank account. Some of the challenges faced in building a model using python are explained below 
 
1. The selection of a suitable churn modelling approach 
There is no single methodology to build a predictive model that can work in most situations. Machine learning techniques are mostly used by businesses due to their efficiency and ability to categorize and manipulate complex data sets. The approach of survival analysis, on the other hand, uses survival and hazard functions to predict which individual own a bank account for a particular period. So, the best solution to deal with this challenge is to compare the performance of several models and identify the most effective method for your business. 
 
 
2. Exploratory analysis 
Businesses face several roadblocks and risks at this stage of building predictive models such as lack of information, target leakage, and the need for optimal feature transformations. Along with domain knowledge, businesses must also have the required skills and creativity to build robust predictive models.  Therefore, it is important that companies execute careful exploratory analysis and build auxiliary models before embarking on building an overall  prediction model. Exploratory analysis can also help in revealing reciprocity, irregularities, outliers, and relationships between different functions, which wouldn’t be possible with domain knowledge alone.
